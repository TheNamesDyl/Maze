# Maze Solver
This was done around 4 years ago, was for a class I took in high school. Not representative of current work.
## Features

1. Generates a maze with cool blue and green graphics
2. Proceeds to solve the maze through trial and error
3. Once it gets to the end, you have what looks like a lame impressionist painting
